"/secret-admin" doesn't have a nav link because it's not supposed to be public (no authorization barriers yet) and can't be accessed by navbar but can be accessed by through through that address. 

No title yet, but it's a model website for doggy daycares/boarding/grooming with a feature that allows you to send an appointment request to the admin. No tests yet.
