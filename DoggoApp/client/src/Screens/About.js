        <p>Founded around 2005, Critter Café provides a broad range of pet food and products. We also offer unique pet services including training, pet grooming, boarding and doggie day care. We believe pets make us better people and we understand that your pets are a part of your family. That is why we love providing every pet who visits us here with individual care and attention. We do our best every day for you and your family and it helps that, We Speak Pet.  With over 3,000 boardings and 7,000 groomings yearly, our passionate associates help bring pet parents closer to their pets so they can live more fulfilled lives. Our vision impacts everything we do for our customers, the way we support our associates, and how we give back to our communities. What helps separate us from most stores is that our grooming is all-inclusive! Whether it’s merely a bath or a full groom, nails (cut or dremeled), ear cleaning and anal glands are included at no extra charge!</p>
